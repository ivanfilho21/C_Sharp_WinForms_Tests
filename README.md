### PrecedenceCalc
* This project has the purpose of creating a Calculator that receives an arithmetic expression as input and outputs the correct calculation, taking into account the order of the operators used in the expression.
* Only these operators can be used at the moment: Plus ( + ), Minus ( - ), Times ( * or ร ) and Divide ( / or รท ).
* TODO: Parenthesis cannot be used to force a precedence.
