# C_Sharp_WinForms_Tests
Tests with C_Sharp and WinForms

I am making these projects so I can learn the basics of Winforms and Visual Studio.

Projects:

This is a Bank system prototype that is required in the book C# from Caelum.

Calculator:
This project aims to deliver a simple calculator based on real calculators.

SimpleNotepad:
This program will be used to take simple notes in a rich text format.
